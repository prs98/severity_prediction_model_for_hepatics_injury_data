# severity_prediction_model_for_hepatics_injury_data
Experimental data were used to develop a model for predicting compounds' probability of causing hepatic injury (i.e. liver damage). The response was categorical (either "does not cause injury", "mild injury" or "severe injury"), and was highly unbalanced. These data can be found in the AppliedPredictiveModeling R package.
